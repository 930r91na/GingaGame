# Ginga Game
Welcome to Ginga Game, an exciting new adventure set across the boundless expanses of space. 
Our game brings the mystique and vastness of the universe to your screen, employing the principles of Verlet integration to create a realistic and engaging physics-based experience.

## Overview
Ginga Game is inspired by the classic Suika game but set in a cosmic environment, instead of fruits there are planets. Players strategically drop planets from the top of a container, aiming to collide planets of the same type. These collisions result in merging, creating larger planets and unlocking new planet types. As the game progresses, the challenge increases with the variety of planets and their unique physics-based interactions. The ultimate objective is to create a sun before the planets fill up the space and reach the top.
