# Ginga Game
Welcome to Ginga Game, an exciting new adventure set across the boundless expanses of space. 
Our game brings the mystique and vastness of the universe to your screen, employing the principles of Verlet integration
to create a realistic and engaging physics-based experience.

## Overview
Ginga Game is inspired by the classic Suika game but set in a cosmic environment, instead of fruits there are planets. 
Players strategically drop planets from the top of a container, aiming to collide planets of the same type. 

There are two different game modes:
- **Game Mode 1**: Merge planets to form stars! Strategically drop and combine planets to unlock new types and battle against rising chaos.
- **Game Mode 2**: Reverse evolution! Combine planets to shrink them, navigating a multi-level funnel. Reach the bottom with the smallest planet to win.
